This guide covers all features available to Catalyst users — from the dashboard and server management to the file manager, SFTP access, backups, scheduling, alerts, and profile settings.

---


## Dashboard

The dashboard is the first page you see after logging in. It provides an overview of your servers and resources.

### Overview

The dashboard displays:

- **Stats cards** — total servers plus running count (admins also see nodes plus connected count, and alerts plus unacknowledged count)
- **Resource metrics** — CPU and memory utilization percentages across your servers
- **Quick actions** — shortcuts to create a server, view servers, or manage your profile
- **Recent activity** — latest server events and actions

### Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between sections:

- **Servers** — Your server list
- **Profile** — Account settings, 2FA, passkeys, API keys
- **Admin** *(if permitted)* — Administrative tools

---

## Server Listing

Navigate to **Servers** to see all servers you have access to.

### Viewing Your Servers

The server list supports:

- **Search** — placeholder **Search by name or node…**
- **Status filter** — per-state values: `running`, `stopped`, `installing`, `starting`, `stopping`, `crashed`, `transferring`, `cloning`, `suspended` (there is no `Transitioning` or `Issues` filter; issue counts appear only as stat cards)
- **Access filter** — All, Owned (servers you created), Other (shared with you)
- **View modes** — Cards or List layout

Each server card shows:

- Server name and status badge
- Node name and location
- Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Quick actions (Start, Stop, Restart)

### Server Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `running` | Server is active |
| `stopped` | Server is not running |
| `starting` | Server is in the process of starting |
| `stopping` | Server is shutting down |
| `installing` | Server is being installed |
| `crashed` | Server process exited unexpectedly |
| `suspended` | Server has been suspended by an admin |
| `transferring` | Server is being moved between nodes |
| `cloning` | Server files are being copied for a clone |
| `restoring` | Server is being restored from a backup |
| `creating_backup` | Server is creating a backup |
| `error` | Server entered an error state (see console and system errors) |
| `archived` | Server is archived (preserved, inactive; still counts toward node capacity) |

---

## Creating a Server

### Prerequisites

- You need the `server.create` permission
- At least one node must be online and have available resources
- At least one server template must be configured

### Steps

1. Navigate to **Servers** and click **New server**.
2. Fill in the configuration:
   - **Name** — a descriptive name for your server
   - **Description** — optional description
   - **Node** — select a target node from the dropdown (only shows nodes you have access to)
   - **Template** — select a game server template (the panel derives the required location from the node)
   - **Disk (MB)** — storage allocation (backend minimum 1024 MB)
   - **Primary Port / Allocation** — pick from the node's pool; `allocationId` for bridge/host modes, auto-assigned IP for IPAM networks
3. Configure resources:
   - **Memory (MB)** — RAM allocation (backend range 512–131072 MB; the UI also gates at 256 MB, but the backend minimum wins)
   - **CPU Cores** — number of CPU cores to allocate (backend range 1–128)
4. Set environment variables — template-specific settings (ports, game modes, etc.)
5. Configure networking:
   - **Primary Allocation** — pick from the node's pool (host mode); the primary port is read-only and populated from the allocation
   - **Port Bindings** — additional port mappings (allocation → container port)
   - **Network Mode** — **Host (port mapping)** or **Macvlan** in the UI (the API also accepts `bridge`, `mc-lan-static`, and `mc-lan-dynamic`)
6. Click **Create server**. Creation creates a `stopped` server row and then starts installation (the UI calls install immediately and takes you to the **Console** tab).

> Java images report inflated placement sizes: small heaps add 64 MB overhead, larger heaps add up to 30% (640–1024 MB cap) unless disabled. An "insufficient memory" error may cite a larger number than the heap you entered.

### What Happens Next

1. The server is created in the database with `installing` status.
2. If the template has an install script, it runs in the specified install image container.
3. Once installation completes, the server transitions to `stopped`.
4. You can then start the server from the console or server details page.

---

## Server Details Page

Click on any server to open its details page. This is the central hub for managing a single server.

### Tabs

The server details page organizes features into tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Console** | Real-time server console output and command input |
| **Files** | Browse, upload, download, edit, and manage files |
| **SFTP** | Generate SFTP connection tokens |
| **Backups** | Create, download, restore, and delete backups |
| **Tasks** | Create and manage scheduled tasks (cron jobs) |
| **Databases** | Create and manage server databases. Hidden when no database hosts are configured on the panel, or the server has no database allocation. |
| **Metrics** | View historical CPU, memory, and disk usage charts |
| **Alerts** | Configure alert rules for this server |
| **Mod Manager** | Browse and install mods (CurseForge, Modrinth, Paper) |
| **Plugin Manager** | Browse and install plugins (Modrinth, Spigot, Paper) |
| **Configuration** | Edit template (startup) variables |
| **Activity** | View recent actions performed on this server |
| **Users** | Manage sub-users and invites |
| **Settings** | Server name and resource allocations |
| **Admin** *(owner, `admin.write`, or `server.delete` holders)* | Node transfer, ownership transfer, allocations, restart policy, suspension, archive/restore, reinstall, delete |

### Server Controls

At the top of the details page, you'll find quick-action buttons:

- **Start** — start the server
- **Stop** — gracefully stop the server
- **Restart** — stop and start the server
- **Kill** — force-kill the server process

### Server Overview

The overview section displays:

- Server name, status, and uptime
- Node and template information
- Resource allocation vs. actual usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Primary IP and port
- Owner information

---

## Server Console

The console provides real-time interaction with your server.

### Accessing the Console

Navigate to your server → **Console** tab (route `/servers/:serverId/console`, i.e. the `console` tab of `/servers/:serverId/:tab?`).

### Features

- **Real-time output** — server stdout, stderr, system messages, and your input are streamed via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Command input** — type commands and press Enter to send them to the server
- **Command history** — press ↑/↓ arrow keys to cycle through previous commands
- **Stream filters** — toggle visibility of stdout (green), stderr (red), system (blue), and stdin (yellow) streams via filter buttons. This helps separate different log types when debugging.
- **Search** — search within console output
- **Copy** — copy all visible console output to clipboard
- **Auto-scroll** — automatically scrolls to the latest output (can be toggled off)
- **Clear** — clear the console buffer

### Sending Commands

Commands can only be sent when:

1. The server is **running**
2. You are not **suspended**
3. The SSE connection is **active** (or reconnecting)

Type a command in the input field and press **Enter**. The command is sent via HTTP POST to the server's agent.

### EULA Prompts

Some game servers (like Minecraft) require EULA acceptance. When the server prompts for EULA acceptance, Catalyst displays a modal dialog where you can accept or decline.

### Console API

```bash
# Stream console output (SSE)
curl -N -H "Cookie: <session>" \
  https://your-catalyst.example.com/api/servers/:serverId/console/stream

# Send a command
curl -X POST -H "Cookie: <session>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"command": "list"}' \
  https://your-catalyst.example.com/api/servers/:serverId/console/command
```

### Console Optimization

The console uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) with advanced optimization:

- **32ms batched flush** — console output is accumulated and flushed in 32ms batches to reduce network overhead
- **Pre-allocated IDs** — each console entry has a pre-allocated ID for deduplication
- **Polling fallback** — if the SSE connection drops, the console automatically falls back to HTTP polling
- **Line/byte limits** — console output is rate-limited by the `consoleOutputLinesMax` and `consoleOutputByteLimitBytes` security settings to prevent resource exhaustion

> **Note:** The default console buffer is configurable via `CONSOLE_OUTPUT_BYTE_LIMIT_BYTES` (default: 256 KB). Admins can increase this in Admin → Security settings.

---

## File Manager

The file manager allows you to browse and manage your server's files directly from the web interface.

### Accessing the File Manager

Navigate to your server → **Files** tab.

### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Browse** | Navigate directories and view files |
| **Upload** | Upload files from your computer |
| **Download** | Download files to your computer |
| **Edit** | Edit text-based files in the built-in editor |
| **Create** | Create new files and directories |
| **Rename** | Rename files and directories |
| **Delete** | Delete files and directories |
| **Compress** | Create `.tar.gz` archives from selected files |
| **Decompress** | Extract `.tar.gz` archives |
| **Permissions** | View file permissions |
| **Search** | Search for files by name |

### File Operations

**Upload files:**
1. Navigate to the target directory.
2. Click **Upload**.
3. Select files from your computer.
4. Files are transferred via the file tunnel system to the node agent.

**Edit a file:**
1. Click on a text-based file to open it in the built-in text editor.
2. The editor shows the **file path**, **filename**, and **line count** at the top.
3. Make your changes in the editor.
4. Changes are tracked with **dirty state** — a visual indicator shows unsaved changes.
5. Click **Save** to write changes to the server. Click **Cancel** to discard.
6. The editor supports standard text editing operations (copy, paste, find/replace in most browsers).

**Compress files:**
1. Select one or more files/directories.
2. Click **Compress**.
3. Enter an archive name.
4. The archive is created as a `.tar.gz` file.

**Browse archive contents:**
1. Select a `.tar.gz` archive file.
2. Click **Browse Contents** (or use the file manager to navigate into the archive).
3. The archive contents are displayed as a virtual directory — you can browse files without extracting.
4. Individual files can be previewed or downloaded directly from the archive.

> **Note:** Archive browsing is limited by the `maxBufferMb` security setting. Large archives may require increasing the buffer limit in admin settings.

**Decompress an archive:**
1. Select a `.tar.gz` archive.
2. Click **Decompress**.
3. The contents are extracted in place.

### Path Security

- File operations are restricted to the server's data directory.
- Paths are normalized and validated to prevent directory traversal.
- Maximum directory depth is enforced.
- The root path `/` maps to the server's data directory.

### File Tunnel

File operations use a secure tunnel system where the panel communicates with node agents to perform file I/O. Operations are rate-limited and size-restricted for security.

### Server Logs

Access the server log file via the API (`GET /api/servers/:id/logs`) or the **Files** tab (there is no separate **Logs** tab):

```bash
GET /api/servers/:serverId/logs
```

---

## SFTP Access

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) allows you to access your server files using any SFTP client (FileZilla, WinSCP, Cyberduck, etc.).

### How SFTP Works in Catalyst

Catalyst runs a dedicated SFTP server (default port: 2022). Instead of using your account password, you generate short-lived SFTP tokens from the panel.

### Connecting via SFTP

1. Navigate to your server → **SFTP** tab.
2. Click **Generate Token**.
3. Select a **TTL (time-to-live)** for the token:

   | Option | Duration |
   |--------|----------|
   | 5 minutes | 5 min |
   | 15 minutes | 15 min |
   | 30 minutes | 30 min |
   | 1 hour | 1 hour |
   | 6 hours | 6 hours |
   | 24 hours | 24 hours |
   | 7 days | 7 days |
   | 30 days | 30 days |
   | 90 days | 90 days |
   | 1 year | 1 year |

4. Copy the generated token (starts with `sftp_`).
5. Configure your SFTP client:

   | Field | Value |
   |-------|-------|
   | **Host** | Node public address or hostname from connection-info (the **game node**, not necessarily the panel URL) |
   | **Port** | Node SFTP port (often `2022`) |
   | **Username** | Server ID (`serverId`) |
   | **Password** | Opaque `sftp_` token from the panel |

6. Connect to access your server's file directory on that node.

### SFTP Security

- Tokens are single-purpose and scoped to a specific user + server pair.
- Tokens automatically expire after the selected TTL.
- Tokens are opaque (`sftp_…`), stored in panel memory, and validated by the agent via the backend.
- Tokens are automatically revoked when you lose access to a server.
- File operations are restricted to the server's data directory on the agent (path isolation, not OS chroot).

### SFTP Client Examples

**FileZilla:**
1. File → Site Manager → New Site
2. Protocol: SFTP
3. Host: `<node-address>`, Port: `2022` (or the port shown in connection-info)
4. Logon Type: Normal
5. User: `<server-id>`, Password: `sftp_<token>`

**Command line (sftp):**
```bash
# username is the server id; password is the sftp_ token
sftp -P 2022 "<server-id>@<node-address>"
```

**curl:**
```bash
curl -sftp -u "<server-id>:sftp_<token>" \
  --url "sftp://<node-address>:2022/"
```

## Backup Management

### Creating a Backup

1. Navigate to your server → **Backups** tab.
2. Click **Create backup**.
3. Optionally enter a custom backup name.
4. The backup is created as a `.tar.gz` archive of your server's files.

**Requirements:**
- The server's node must be online.
- Backup allocation must be configured, or external storage (S3/SFTP) must be set up.
- The server cannot be suspended.

### Restoring a Backup

1. **Stop** the server first (backups can only be restored to stopped servers).
2. Navigate to **Backups** tab.
3. Find the backup you want to restore.
4. Click **Restore**.
5. Confirm the restoration.

**Warning:** Restoration replaces all server files with the backup contents.

### Downloading a Backup

Click **Download** on any backup to save the `.tar.gz` file to your computer. Downloads work for local, S3, SFTP, and stream storage modes.

### Deleting a Backup

Click **Delete** to remove a backup. This permanently deletes the backup from all storage backends.

### Backup Storage

Your admin configures where backups are stored:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Local** | Stored on the panel server's filesystem |
| **S3** | Stored in S3-compatible cloud storage |
| **SFTP** | Stored on a remote SFTP server |
| **Stream** | Transferred directly to target node during server transfer (zero-copy relay) |

### Backup Retention

Admins can configure retention policies per server:
- **Count** — maximum number of backups to keep
- **Days** — maximum age of backups to keep

---

## Server Settings

The **Settings** tab covers name, description, and resource allocations. Template (startup) variables live under the **Configuration** tab; node transfer, ownership transfer, allocations, restart policy, suspension, archive/restore, reinstall, and delete live under the **Admin** tab (see the tab table above).

### Server Information

- **Name** — rename your server
- **Description** — update the description

### Resources

- **Memory (MB)** — adjust RAM allocation
- **CPU Cores** — adjust CPU core allocation

### Startup (Configuration tab)

- **Startup variables** — template variables with descriptions and validation rules (supports `{{VARIABLE}}` interpolation)
- The template's startup/stop command and signal are template-level settings, not per-server edits

### Port Bindings (Admin tab)

- **Primary Allocation** — the main game allocation (read-only in host mode)
- **Additional Bindings** — map container ports to host ports
- **Allocations** — view and select from node-level port allocations

### Advanced Settings (Admin tab)

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reinstall** | Re-run the template's install script (requires server to be stopped) |
| **Rebuild** | Rebuild the container without reinstalling (faster than reinstall, preserves data directory) |
| **Archive** | Archive the server (requires admin access; stops the server if running) |
| **Restore** | Restore a server from archive (requires admin access; server must be archived) |
| **Transfer** | Transfer server to another node (requires `server.transfer` permission, server must be stopped) |
| **Transfer Ownership** | Transfer server ownership to another user (server owner or `admin.write`; pick from **transfer candidates**, not by typing an email) |
| **Delete** | Permanently delete the server (requires `server.delete` permission; allowed from `stopped`, `error`, `crashed`, or `installing`) |
| **Suspend** | Suspend the server (admin only; prevents all server operations) |
| **Unsuspend** | Resume a suspended server (admin only) |
| **Restart Policy** | Configure auto-restart behavior on crash (see below) |
| **Backup Settings** | Configure per-server backup storage (see below) |

### Transfer Server (Node Transfer)

Server owners can transfer a server to another node on the cluster:

1. Navigate to **Settings**.
2. Find the **Transfer** section and click **Transfer to Another Node**.
3. Select the target node from the dropdown (only shows online nodes with enough resources).
4. Confirm the transfer.

**Requirements:**
- You must be the server owner or hold `admin.write` (ownership transfer does not use `server.transfer`; node transfer does).
- The server must be **stopped**.
- The target node must be **online**.
- The target node must have enough resources (CPU and memory) to accommodate the server.

**How it works:**
1. The server status changes to `transferring`.
2. A backup stream is created on the source node.
3. The stream is relayed directly to the target node (zero-copy — files never touch the panel).
4. Once the transfer completes, the server's IP is reassigned to the target node (if using IPAM).
5. The server returns to `stopped` status on the new node.

### Transfer Server Ownership

Server owners can transfer ownership to another user:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Transfer Ownership**.
2. Enter the target user's email or username.
3. Confirm the transfer.

The target user must have an existing account on the panel. Pick them from the transfer-candidates list (search needs at least 3 characters). Ownership transfer requires owner or `admin.write`.

### Restart Policy

Configure how the server handles unexpected crashes:

- **Restart on exit** — automatically restart when the process exits
- **Crash counter** — tracks consecutive crashes to prevent restart loops
- **Reset crash count** — manually reset the crash counter (accessible from Settings → Admin tab)

When the server crashes multiple times in succession, the crash counter prevents infinite restart loops. The admin can configure the maximum number of restarts before the server is marked as `issues` status.

### Backup Settings (Admin/Owner)

Configure per-server backup storage:

- **Storage Mode** — local, S3, SFTP, or stream
- **S3 Configuration** — bucket, region, access key, secret key, endpoint
- **SFTP Configuration** — host, port, username, password/private key, base path
- **Backup Allocation** — disk space reserved for local backups (MB)
- **Retention** — max backup count and max age (days)

Backup settings are managed per-server. The admin sets defaults, and server owners can override them within allowed limits.

---

## Server Scheduling (Tasks)

Create automated tasks (cron jobs) that run on a schedule for your server.

### Creating a Task

1. Navigate to your server → **Tasks** tab (header **Scheduled Tasks**).
2. Click **Create Task**.
3. Configure:
   - **Name** — descriptive name for the task
   - **Action** — what the task does:
     - `start` — Start the server
     - `stop` — Stop the server
     - `restart` — Restart the server
     - `backup` — Create a backup
     - `command` — Send a command to the console
   - **Payload** — for `command` actions, the command string to send
   - **Schedule** — cron expression defining when the task runs
4. Click **Create**.

### Cron Expression Examples

| Expression | Schedule |
|-----------|----------|
| `0 3 * * *` | Every day at 3:00 AM |
| `*/30 * * * *` | Every 30 minutes |
| `0 */6 * * *` | Every 6 hours |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Every Sunday at midnight |
| `0 0 1 * *` | First of every month at midnight |

### Task Management

- **Execute now** — run the task immediately (useful for testing)
- **Enable/Disable** — toggle the task on or off
- **Edit** — modify name, action, payload, or schedule
- **Delete** — remove the task permanently

### Task Execution History

Each task tracks:

- **Last run** — when it was last executed
- **Run count** — total number of executions
- **Last status** — `success` or `failed`
- **Last error** — error message if the last execution failed
- **Next run** — calculated next execution time

---

## Alerts

Configure alert rules to monitor your server's health and receive notifications.

### Creating an Alert Rule

1. Navigate to your server → **Alerts** tab.
2. Click **Create Alert Rule**.
3. Configure:
   - **Name** — descriptive name
   - **Type** — alert trigger type:
     - `resource_threshold` — triggered when resource usage exceeds a threshold
     - `node_offline` — triggered when the node goes offline
     - `server_crashed` — triggered when the server crashes
   - **Conditions** — threshold values and comparison operators
   - **Actions** — what happens when the alert fires (webhook, notification)
   - **Enabled** — toggle the rule on or off

### Viewing Alerts

The alerts page shows all alerts for your server with filtering by:

- **Severity** — info, warning, critical
- **Resolved status** — unresolved or resolved
- **Type** — alert type

### Resolving Alerts

Click **Resolve** on an alert to mark it as handled. You can also bulk-resolve multiple alerts at once.

### Alert Statistics

View summary statistics:

- Total alerts count
- Unresolved alerts count
- Breakdown by severity and type

---

## Mod Manager

If the server template supports mod management, a **Mod Manager** tab is available.

### Browsing Mods

1. Navigate to your server → **Mod Manager** tab.
2. Browse available mods from supported providers:
   - **CurseForge** — requires admin-configured API key
   - **Modrinth** — requires admin-configured API key
   - **Paper** — Paper server builds (no API key required)
3. Search by name, filter by category, game version, or loader.
4. View trending/top downloads when no search query is entered.

### Installing Mods

1. Find the mod you want to install.
2. Select the desired version.
3. Choose the installation target (e.g., `mods`, `datapacks`, `modpacks`).
4. Click **Install**.
5. The mod file is downloaded to the configured path (e.g., `/mods`).

### Managing Installed Mods

- **View** — see all installed mods with version info and provider details
- **Uninstall** — remove a mod from the server
- **Check for updates** — scan installed mods for available updates (rate-limited to 5 checks per minute)
- **Update** — update a mod to the latest version

### Game Version Resolution

The mod manager can resolve game versions from Modrinth to ensure compatibility. Select your game version to filter compatible mods. For Paper builds, the provider resolves available versions automatically.

---

## Plugin Manager

If the server template supports plugin management, a **Plugin Manager** tab is available. Similar to the Mod Manager but for server plugins (e.g., Spigot/Bukkit plugins for Minecraft).

### Browsing Plugins

1. Navigate to your server → **Plugin Manager** tab.
2. Browse plugins from supported providers:
   - **Modrinth** — requires admin-configured API key
   - **Spigot** — SpigotMC plugin downloads (no API key required)
   - **Paper** — Paper plugin builds (no API key required)
3. Search by name, filter by category, and version.
4. View trending/top downloads when no search query is entered.

### Installing Plugins

1. Find the plugin you want to install.
2. Select the desired version.
3. Click **Install**.
4. The plugin file (`.jar`) is downloaded to the configured path (e.g., `/plugins`).

### Managing Installed Plugins

- **Uninstall** — remove a plugin from the server
- **Check for updates** — scan installed plugins for available updates (rate-limited to 5 checks per minute)
- **Update** — update a plugin to the latest version

---

## Server Activity

The **Activity** tab shows a timeline of all actions performed on this server.

### Viewing Activity

1. Navigate to your server → **Activity** tab.
2. The log displays the most recent 25 actions with:
   - **Action type** — e.g., "Server started", "Backup created", "Console command sent"
   - **Timestamp** — when the action occurred
   - **User** — who performed the action (if applicable)
3. Pages through 25 entries at a time (auto-refreshes every 10 seconds).

### Activity Events

Common events tracked:
- Server power actions (start, stop, restart, kill)
- Backup creation and restoration
- Console command execution
- File operations (upload, download, edit, delete)
- Settings changes (resources, startup command, ports)
- User access changes (invites, revokes)
- Mod/plugin installation and removal
- Task execution
- Server suspension/resumption/archiving
- Node transfer

---

## Server Archiving

**Archiving** is an admin-level feature that preserves a server without deleting it.

### Archiving a Server

1. Navigate to your server → **Admin** tab.
2. Click **Archive Server**.
3. The server is immediately set to `archived` status.
4. If the server was running, it is gracefully stopped before archiving.

**Effects of archiving:**
- The server is removed from active node resource calculations.
- The server remains in the database with all configuration intact.
- The server cannot be started until restored.
- Files remain on the node's filesystem.

### Restoring an Archived Server

1. Navigate to your server → **Admin** tab.
2. Click **Restore Server**.
3. The server status returns to `stopped`.
4. The server reappears in the server list and can be started normally.

---

## Server Suspension

Servers can be **suspended** by administrators to temporarily disable a server without deleting it.

### Why Servers Get Suspended

- **Non-payment** — if payment integration is configured
- **Resource abuse** — exceeding CPU, memory, or disk limits
- **Policy violations** — violating terms of service
- **Investigation** — pending security review
- **Manual admin action** — at admin discretion

### How Suspension Appears to Users

When a server is suspended:

1. The server status shows as `suspended` in the server list.
2. A **suspension reason** is displayed (set by the admin).
3. The server cannot be started, stopped, or modified.
4. The console shows a message: "This server has been suspended. Contact your admin for details."

### Resuming a Suspended Server

Only administrators can unsuspend a server:

1. Navigate to **Admin** → **Servers**.
2. Find the suspended server.
3. Click **Unsuspend**.
4. The server returns to its previous state (stopped or running).

### Server Suspension API

```bash
# Suspend a server (admin only)
POST /api/servers/:serverId/suspend

# Unsuspend a server (admin only)
POST /api/servers/:serverId/unsuspend
```

If your admin has configured database hosts, you can create and manage databases for your server.

### Creating a Database

1. Navigate to your server → **Databases** tab.
2. Click **Create Database**.
3. Select a database host from the available hosts.
4. Enter a database name.
5. Click **Create**.

The database is provisioned on the remote database server, and connection credentials are displayed.

### Database Credentials

After creation, you'll see:

- **Host** — the database host address
- **Port** — the database port
- **Database name** — your database name
- **Username** — auto-generated username
- **Password** — auto-generated password

### Managing Databases

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **View** | See all databases with connection details |
| **Rotate Password** | Generate a new password for a database |
| **Delete** | Remove a database and its data |

---

## Server Metrics

View historical resource usage charts for your server.

### Available Metrics

- **CPU Usage** — percentage over time
- **Memory Usage** — MB used over time
- **Disk Usage** — MB used over time

## Password Recovery

If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it using the password recovery flow.

### Resetting Your Password

1. Go to the login page at `/login`.
2. Click **Forgot Password?**
3. Enter the email address associated with your account.
4. Click **Send Reset Link**.
5. Check your email inbox for a password reset message.

### Completing the Reset

1. Click the link in the reset email.
2. You'll be taken to the **Reset Password** page at `/reset-password`.
3. Enter your new password (must meet complexity requirements).
4. Confirm the new password.
5. Click **Reset Password**.

You'll be redirected to the login page. Sign in with your new password.

### Email Delivery Requirements

Password recovery requires SMTP to be configured by your administrator:

- The admin must configure SMTP settings in **Admin → System** (`/admin/system`).
- Settings include: SMTP host, port, username, password, from address, and SSL/TLS options.
- If SMTP is not configured, password reset emails cannot be delivered.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Didn't receive the reset email | Check spam/junk folder; wait up to 5 minutes |
| Link expired | Request a new reset link (links expire after 1 hour) |
| Token invalid | Click "Request Reset" again — don't reuse old links |
| Admin says SMTP isn't configured | Contact your server administrator to configure email |

### Security

- Password reset tokens use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.
- Tokens are single-use only.
- Failed reset attempts are rate-limited.

---

## Forgot Password & Reset Password Pages

These pages handle the complete password recovery flow in Catalyst.

### Forgot Password Page (`/forgot-password`)

When a user cannot remember their password, they visit the Forgot Password page.

**How to access:**
1. Go to the login page (`/login`).
2. Click the **Forgot Password?** link below the login form.
3. You'll be taken to `/forgot-password`.

**What the page does:**
1. Shows a single input field for the email address.
2. Validates the email format before submitting.
3. Sends a password reset email via better-auth if the email is registered.
4. Displays a confirmation message: "If an account exists for this email, you'll receive a password reset link."

> **Note:** For security, the page does NOT reveal whether an email is registered — the confirmation message is identical whether the email exists or not.

**What happens after submission:**
1. A password reset token is generated (1-hour expiry).
2. An email is sent to the registered address with a reset link.
3. The token uses constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.
4. Failed requests are rate-limited (typically 3 per hour per IP).

**Email contents:**
- A link to `/reset-password?token=<token>`
- Instructions for resetting the password
- A note that the link expires in 1 hour

### Reset Password Page (`/reset-password`)

This page completes the password recovery flow. It is accessed via the link in the reset email.

**How to access:**
1. Click the reset link in your password recovery email.
2. You'll be taken to `/reset-password?token=<token>`.

**What the page does:**
1. Validates the reset token in constant-time.
2. Displays two password fields: **New Password** and **Confirm New Password**.
3. Validates password complexity requirements (min 8 characters, matches common password lists, etc.).
4. When submitted:
   - The token is consumed (single-use only).
   - The user's password is updated in the database.
   - The user is redirected to the login page.
5. If the token is expired or already used, an error is displayed and the user is redirected to the Forgot Password page.

**Password requirements:**
| Requirement | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Minimum length** | 8 characters |
| **Maximum length** | 128 characters |
| **Cannot contain** | Common passwords, email address, username |

## 2FA Setup Page Details

The 2FA Setup page (`/two-factor`) handles the complete 2FA enrollment flow.

### Accessing the 2FA Setup Page

Navigate to **Profile** → **Security** → **Two-Factor Authentication**, or go directly to `/two-factor`.

### Step 1 — Verify Current Password

Before enabling 2FA, you must verify your current password:
1. Enter your current password in the verification field.
2. Click **Enable 2FA**.
3. The system validates the password before proceeding.

### Step 2 — Scan QR Code

After password verification, a QR code is displayed:
1. Open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.).
2. Scan the QR code shown on the page.
3. The QR code contains the TOTP secret key encoded as a `otpauth://totp/` URI.
4. The app generates 6-digit codes that change every 30 seconds.

### Step 3 — Enter Verification Code

After scanning the QR code:
1. Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app.
2. Click **Verify**.
3. The system validates the code using time-based one-time password (TOTP) algorithm.
4. If valid, 2FA is enabled.

### Step 4 — Save Backup Codes

10 backup codes are generated. Each code can be used **only once**:
1. Display the codes on screen.
2. Copy them to a password manager, printed document, or secure location.
3. Click **I've Saved My Backup Codes** to proceed.

> **Important:** If you lose access to your authenticator device, these backup codes are your only way to log in. They cannot be recovered.

### Trust Device Option

During the verification step (Step 3), you'll see a checkbox: **"Trust this device for 30 days."**

When checked:
- Your browser fingerprint is stored server-side as a trusted device identifier.
- For 30 days, you won't need to enter a 2FA code from this browser.
- The device identity is based on a cryptographic fingerprint, not cookies alone.
- Each trusted device shows its registration date and fingerprint hash in the 2FA settings.
- You can revoke trust at any time by clicking **Revoke Trust** next to the device.
- Revoking a trusted device immediately requires 2FA on the next login attempt.

### Disabling 2FA

To disable 2FA:
1. Navigate to **Profile** → **Two-Factor Authentication**.
2. Enter a valid 2FA code from your authenticator.
3. Click **Disable 2FA**.
4. All backup codes are immediately invalidated.
5. Trusted devices are also untrusteds.

### Backup Code Usage

If you lose your authenticator device:
1. Go to the login page.
2. Click **Use a backup code** instead of entering a 2FA code.
3. Enter one of your 10 backup codes.
4. You'll be prompted to:
   - Generate new backup codes (invalidating the old ones)
   - Re-enable 2FA with a new QR code

## Cross-Tab Session Synchronization

Catalyst automatically keeps your sessions synchronized across all open browser tabs.

### How It Works

- When you log in to Catalyst in one tab, all other open tabs are automatically logged in.
- When you log out from any tab, you are logged out of ALL tabs simultaneously.
- When your session expires, all tabs are notified and redirect to the login page.

### Technical Details

The synchronization is powered by two mechanisms:

1. **BroadcastChannel API** — a browser API that sends messages between tabs sharing the same origin. The `authStore` listens on the `catalyst-auth` channel and broadcasts session state changes to all tabs.
2. **localStorage event listeners** — as a fallback, changes are also stored in `localStorage` and listened for via the `storage` event.

This ensures that even if a tab is in a different browser window or process, it will still receive session state updates within milliseconds.

### What Gets Synced

| Event | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Login** | All tabs refresh their auth state; sidebar updates to show logged-in menu |
| **Logout** | All tabs clear auth state and redirect to `/login` |
| **Session Expiry** | All tabs detect the expired session and redirect to `/login` |
| **2FA Enabled** | All tabs detect the change and may require re-authentication |
| **Password Changed** | All tabs are logged out (other sessions are revoked) |
| **API Key Created/Deleted** | All tabs update their API key list |

> **Note:** Cross-tab sync only works within the same browser and the same Catalyst panel. It does not sync across different browsers or different panel instances.

## Brute Force Protection & Lockout Viewer

Catalyst protects against brute-force login attempts through a combination of rate limiting, IP blocking, email blocking, and a lockout viewer.

### How Brute Force Protection Works

1. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Login attempts are limited to a configurable number per minute (default: 10 requests/minute per IP).
   - Exceeding the rate limit results in a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
   - The rate limiter uses a sliding window algorithm for accuracy.

2. **Lockout Policy:**
   - After a configurable number of consecutive failed login attempts (default: 5), the user's IP is blocked for a configurable duration (default: 30 minutes).
   - The user's email can also be blocked independently (if email lockout is enabled).
   - Lockouts are stored in the database and checked on every login attempt.

3. **Secure Token Comparison:**
   - All authentication tokens use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks.
   - This ensures that the time taken to compare tokens is the same regardless of whether the tokens match or not.

### Lockout Viewer

The lockout viewer (available in Admin → Security) displays all active lockouts in real-time:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **IP Address** | The blocked IP address |
| **Email** | The blocked email address (if email lockout is enabled) |
| **Failure Count** | Number of failed attempts that triggered the lockout |
| **Last Failed** | Timestamp of the most recent failed login attempt |
| **Status** | `locked` or `unlocked` (manually cleared by admin) |
| **Actions** | Click **Clear** to manually remove a lockout |

**Features:**
- **Search:** Filter lockouts by IP address or email.
- **Pagination:** 50 entries per page.
- **Auto-Refresh:** Updates every 30 seconds to show lockouts that are expiring.
- **Manual Clear:** Admins can immediately release a locked IP or email without waiting for the lockout to expire.

### Additional Security Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Password Reset Rate Limiting** | Forgot password requests are rate-limited (typically 3 per hour per IP) |
| **Email Enumeration Prevention** | The forgot password page returns the same message whether the email exists or not |
| **Session Revocation** | Changing your password revokes all other sessions |
| **Token Expiry** | Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour and are single-use |
| **CORS Protection** | `@fastify/cors` restricts cross-origin requests to trusted domains |
| **Helmet Headers** | `@fastify/helmet` sets secure HTTP headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS) |

## File Editing in File Manager

The File Manager includes a built-in text editor for editing configuration files directly from the web interface.

### Accessing the Editor

1. Navigate to your server → **Files** tab.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the file you want to edit.
3. Click on a text-based file (`.txt`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.cfg`, `.sh`, `.js`, `.py`, `.java`, etc.).

### Editor Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **File Path Display** | Shows the full server path to the file being edited |
| **File Name** | Displays the file name at the top of the editor |
| **Line Count** | Shows the total number of lines in the file |
| **Dirty State Tracking** | Visual indicator (orange dot) shows unsaved changes |
| **Save Button** | Writes changes to the server; only available when there are unsaved changes |
| **Cancel Button** | Discards all unsaved changes and returns to file browser |
| **Standard Text Editing** | Copy, paste, find/replace, multi-line selection supported by the browser's text editor |
| **Auto-Save Prevention** | Browser's auto-save and spell-check can interfere; disable in browser settings if needed |

### Editing Workflow

1. Click the file to open it in the editor.
2. Make your changes.
3. An orange dot appears next to the file name in the file list — this indicates unsaved changes.
4. Click **Save** to write the changes to the server.
5. If you close the editor without saving, changes are discarded.
6. If the file becomes too large, the editor may prompt you to open it in an external editor.

> **⚠️ Warning:** The file editor is not suitable for binary files (images, executables, archives). Editing binary files with the text editor may corrupt them. Use the upload/download features for binary files.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enable 2FA for additional account security.

### Enabling 2FA

1. Navigate to **Profile** → **2FA** section.
2. Click **Enable 2FA**.
3. You will be prompted to enter your current password for confirmation.
4. A QR code is displayed for your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
5. Scan the QR code.
6. Enter the 6-digit verification code from your authenticator app.
7. **Save your backup codes** — these one-time codes can be used if you lose access to your authenticator.
8. Click **Confirm** to complete setup.

### Backup Codes

When you enable 2FA, 10 backup codes are generated:

- Store them in a safe, accessible place (password manager, printed copy, etc.)
- Each code can be used **only once**
- Use them to log in if you lose your authenticator device
- You can generate new backup codes at any time from the 2FA section (current codes are invalidated)

### Trust Device Option

During 2FA verification, you can check **"Trust this device for 30 days"**:

- When checked, subsequent logins from the same device/browser won't require a 2FA code for 30 days
- Only the browser fingerprint (not cookies alone) is used to verify device identity
- You can revoke trust at any time from the 2FA section
- Revoking a trusted device immediately requires 2FA on next login

### Disabling 2FA

1. Enter a valid 2FA code from your authenticator.
2. Click **Disable 2FA**.

---

## Passkeys / WebAuthn

Passkeys provide passwordless authentication using biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition) or hardware security keys.

### Adding a Passkey (2-Step Registration)

Passkey registration uses a 2-step process for enhanced security:

**Step 1 — Name the passkey:**
1. Navigate to **Profile** → **Passkeys** section.
2. Click **Add Passkey**.
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "MacBook Touch ID", "YubiKey") to identify it later.
4. Click **Continue**.

**Step 2 — Verify with biometrics/security key:**
1. Your browser prompts for biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello) or security key insertion.
2. Complete the authentication.
3. The passkey is registered.

> **Why 2 steps?** The name is committed first to prevent phishing — an attacker can't intercept the biometric challenge without also knowing which passkey you're registering.

### Using Passkeys

On the login page, click **Sign in with Passkey** instead of entering a password. Your browser will prompt for biometric authentication or security key.

### Managing Passkeys

- **View** — see all registered passkeys with their names and registration dates
- **Delete** — remove a passkey

---

## Session Management

View and manage your active sessions.

### Viewing Sessions

Navigate to **Profile** → **Sessions** section. Each session shows:

- **Device** — browser name and operating system
- **IP Address** — where the session was created
- **Last Active** — when the session was last used
- **Created** — when the session started

### Revoking Sessions

Click **Revoke** on any session to immediately log out that device. This is useful if you suspect unauthorized access or want to log out of a device you no longer have access to.
