---

## Step 1: Initial Setup and Login

### Production / Docker path (default)

1. Open your browser to your `PUBLIC_URL` (for example `http://localhost:8080`, not bare `:80` unless you changed `FRONTEND_PORT`).
2. On a fresh install the panel requires **Setup** (`/setup`):
   1. **Welcome**
   2. **Admin Account** — email, username, password for the first administrator
   3. **Appearance** — branding/theme options
3. Finish setup. Catalyst creates the **Administrator** role (`*`), assigns it to your user, and **disables open self-registration**.
4. Sign in with **Sign in** using the credentials you just created.

You land on the dashboard overview.

> **Do not rely on seed accounts for production.** Seed users exist only if you deliberately ran a seed script in a development environment.

### Development seed path (optional)

If you ran `pnpm run db:seed` / `db:seed:admin` (or equivalent) in a **dev** environment, you may sign in with the seed admin:

- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`

**Change this password immediately.** Seed credentials are not part of the Docker one-liner production path.

### Registration after setup

Open registration is **off** after setup. Admins can re-enable it under **Admin → Security**. When enabled, new users use **Create account** with:

- **Email** — unique
- **Username** — 2–32 characters, unique
- **Password** — minimum 8 characters (complexity rules apply)

New self-registered users receive the default **User** role (limited access). They do **not** become administrators.

### Forgot Password Flow

If you forget your password after creating an account:

1. On the login page, click **Forgot Password?**
2. Enter the email address associated with your account.
3. Click **Send Reset Link**.
4. Check your email for the reset message.
5. Click the link in the email and enter your new password.
6. Sign in with the new password.

> **Note:** Password recovery requires SMTP to be configured by your administrator. If you don't receive the email, contact your server admin to verify email settings.

### Reset Password Page

After clicking the reset link, you'll be taken to the Reset Password page (`/reset-password`):
1. The page validates the reset token (1-hour expiry, single-use only).
2. Enter your new password (min 8 characters) and confirm it.
3. Click **Reset Password**.
4. You're redirected to the login page.

> **Security:** Reset tokens use constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks. Failed attempts are rate-limited.

---

### Cross-Tab Session Synchronization

Catalyst automatically keeps your sessions synchronized across all open browser tabs:

- When you log in to Catalyst in one tab, all other open tabs are automatically logged in.
- When you log out from any tab, you are logged out of **ALL tabs simultaneously**.
- When your session expires, all tabs are notified and redirect to the login page.
- Password changes revoke all other sessions across all tabs.

This is powered by the `BroadcastChannel` API and `localStorage` event listeners, ensuring that even if a tab is in a different browser window, it will still receive session state updates within milliseconds.

> **Note:** Cross-tab sync only works within the same browser and the same Catalyst panel. It does not sync across different browsers or different panel instances.

---

## Step 2: Configure Your Profile

After your first login, update your admin profile:

1. Click your **avatar** or username in the top-right corner
2. Navigate to **Profile Settings**
3. Update your display name, first name, and last name
4. Upload an avatar image (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP, max 2 MB). Note: SVG files are not accepted due to XSS risk.

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication

It's strongly recommended to enable 2FA for admin accounts:

1. Go to **Profile** (sidebar user entry → `/profile`) → **Security** → **Two-Factor Authentication**. (There is no standalone `/two-factor` page — that route redirects to `/login`; 2FA setup is inline.)
2. Click **Enable 2FA**.
3. Enter your password to confirm your identity.
4. A **QR code** is displayed — open your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.) and scan the code.
   - The QR code contains a TOTP secret encoded as `otpauth://totp/` URI.
   - Your app will start generating 6-digit codes that change every 30 seconds.
5. Enter the 6-digit verification code from your app to confirm setup.
6. **Save your backup codes** — 10 one-time codes are provided. Store them in a password manager, printed document, or other secure location.
   - Each backup code can be used **only once**.
   - If you lose your authenticator device, backup codes are your only way to log in.

### 2FA Page Features

The 2FA Setup page (`/two-factor`) includes:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Password Verification** | You must enter your current password before enabling 2FA |
| **QR Code Display** | Scannable TOTP secret for authenticator apps |
| **Verification Code Input** | Enter the 6-digit code from your app to confirm |
| **Backup Code Generation** | 10 one-time codes displayed after successful verification |
| **Trust Device Checkbox** | "Trust this device for 30 days" option during verification |
| **Revoke Trusted Devices** | View and revoke trusted devices at any time |
| **Disable 2FA** | Toggle 2FA on/off with current code verification |
| **Generate New Backup Codes** | Invalidate old codes and generate a new set |

### Trust Device Option

During 2FA verification, you'll see a **"Trust this device for 30 days"** checkbox:

- When checked, future logins from the same device/browser won't require a 2FA code for 30 days.
- Device identity is verified via a cryptographic browser fingerprint (not just cookies).
- Each trusted device shows its registration date and fingerprint hash.
- You can revoke a trusted device at any time by clicking **Revoke Trust** next to it.
- Revoking a trusted device immediately requires 2FA on the next login attempt.

### Set Up Passkeys (WebAuthn)

For passwordless login support:

1. Go to **Profile** → **Security** → **Passkeys**.
2. Click **Add Passkey**.
3. Enter a name for the passkey (e.g., "MacBook Touch ID", "YubiKey").
4. Click **Continue**.
5. Follow your browser's biometric prompt (Face ID, Touch ID, Windows Hello, or security key).

> **2-step registration:** Passkeys use a 2-step process — first you name the passkey, then you authenticate. This prevents phishing by committing to the name before biometric verification.

### Change Your Password

1. Go to **Profile** → **Security** → **Change Password**
2. Enter your current password
3. Enter and confirm the new password
4. Optionally check **Revoke other sessions** to sign out all other devices

---

## Step 3: Create a Location

Locations are logical groupings for your nodes (for example data centers or regions).

1. Navigate to **Admin → Nodes**.
2. Open **Locations** (modal from the Nodes page — there is **no** `/admin/locations` route).
3. Create a location with a **Name** (for example `US East 1`) and optional description.
4. Save.

Locations organize nodes and help users choose where to deploy servers.

---

## Step 4: Create a Node

A node is a physical or virtual machine that runs game server containers via the Catalyst agent.

1. Navigate to **Admin → Nodes**.
2. Click **Register Node** (UI label; not “Create Node”).
3. Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Unique identifier for the node | `node-1` |
| **Description** | Optional description | `Main game server node` |
| **Location** | The location from Step 4 | `US East 1` |
| **Hostname** | System hostname of the machine | `node-1.example.com` |
| **Public Address** | IP address or hostname reachable from the panel | `192.168.1.100` |
| **Max Memory (MB)** | Total RAM available for servers | `32000` |
| **Max CPU Cores** | Total CPU cores available | `16` |
| **Server Data Dir** | (Optional) Override data directory path | `/var/lib/catalyst` |

4. Click **Register node**

After creation, the node will appear in the list with an **offline** status until the agent connects.

### Node Allocations

Allocations define the IP:port combinations available on a node. They are managed on a separate page, not in the creation wizard:

1. Select the node from the list
2. Click **Allocations** (opens `/admin/nodes/:nodeId/allocations`)
3. Click **Add Allocation**
4. Enter the IP address and port range:
   - **IP:** `192.168.1.100` or a CIDR range like `10.0.0.0/24`
   - **Ports:** `25565-25585` (supports individual ports, ranges, and comma-separated values)
5. Click **Save**

When creating a server, you'll assign it an allocation from the available pool.

### Generate Agent API Key

The agent needs an API key to authenticate with the panel. Node details has no separate **Agent** tab — key management lives on the node details page:

1. Select the node
2. Click **Generate Key** (or **Regenerate Key** if one exists)
3. **Copy the API key** — you'll need it for the agent configuration

> **Important:** The API key is only shown once. Store it securely.

---

## Step 5: Deploy the Agent

The Catalyst agent is a Rust binary that runs on each node. It manages containers using containerd and communicates with the panel over WebSocket.

### System Requirements

On each node machine:

- **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian 12+, or similar)
- **containerd** installed and running (with CRI plugin)
- **Root access** (required for containerd socket access and network management)
- **Ports:** Agent needs outbound access to the panel's WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`)
- **Network:** The panel must be able to reach the node's public address

### One-Click Deployment

The easiest way to deploy the agent:

1. In the panel, open the node details page and click **Deploy**
2. Click **Generate Deployment Token** if needed
3. This creates a one-time deployment URL (valid for 24 hours) and an API key
4. On the node machine, run the deployment command shown in the dialog (form: `curl -s 'deployUrl?apiKey=...' | sudo bash -x`; use **Copy** to grab it exactly), for example:
   ```bash
   curl -s 'https://your-panel.com/api/deploy/YOUR_TOKEN?apiKey=...' | sudo bash -x
   ```

The deployment script will:
- Install the agent binary
- Generate `config.toml` with the correct settings
- Set up systemd service
- Start the agent

### Manual Agent Setup

If you prefer manual installation:

1. **Build or download** the agent binary:
   ```bash
   # From source
   cd catalyst-agent
   cargo build --release
   sudo cp target/release/catalyst-agent /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. **Create the configuration file** at `/opt/catalyst-agent/config.toml` (the path shown in the panel; `CATALYST_CONFIG_PATH` overrides it):
   ```toml
   [server]
   backend_url = "wss://panel.example.com/ws"
   node_id = "your-node-uuid"
   api_key = "your-api-key-from-panel"
   hostname = "node-1"
   data_dir = "/var/lib/catalyst"
   max_connections = 100

   [containerd]
   socket_path = "/run/containerd/containerd.sock"
   namespace = "catalyst"

   [logging]
   level = "info"
   format = "json"
   ```

3. **Create a systemd service:**
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Catalyst Agent
   After=network-online.target containerd.service
   Requires=containerd.service

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/catalyst-agent --config /opt/catalyst-agent/config.toml
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5s

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

4. **Start the agent:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now catalyst-agent
   ```

### Networking Configuration

The agent supports multiple networking modes for game server containers:

#### macvlan (Recommended for Game Servers)

macvlan gives each container its own MAC address and IP on the network, which is essential for games that need direct IP access (e.g., Minecraft).

Add network configuration to the agent's `config.toml`:

```toml
[[networking.networks]]
name = "mc-lan-static"
interface = "eth0"
cidr = "10.5.5.0/24"
gateway = "10.5.5.1"
range_start = "10.5.5.50"
range_end = "10.5.5.200"
```

If no networks are configured, the agent will automatically create a default network based on the primary interface.

#### Host Networking

For servers that need to bind directly to the host's network interfaces:

When creating a server, set the `networkMode` to `host`. The server will use the node's public IP address directly.

#### Bridge (Default)

Standard Docker bridge networking. The panel handles port forwarding from the host to the container.

---

## Step 6: Server Templates

Templates define how game servers are configured and deployed. Catalyst comes with built-in templates and supports custom ones.

### Using Built-in Templates

After seeding, you'll have two default templates:

#### Minecraft Server (Paper)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Image** | Eclipse Temurin 21 JRE |
| **Default RAM** | 1024 MB |
| **Default CPU** | 2 cores |
| **Port** | 25565 |
| **Features** | Auto-restart, mod manager, plugin manager, file editor |

**Template Variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY` | `1024` | Amount of RAM in MB (512–16384) |
| `MEMORY_XMS` | `512` | Initial heap size in MB (256–8192) |
| `PORT` | `25565` | Server port (1024–65535) |
| `VERSION` | `1.21.11` | Minecraft version to install |
| `BUILD` | *(latest)* | Paper build number (empty = latest) |

#### Node.js Bot (Git Repository)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Image** | Node.js 20 (Debian Slim) |
| **Default RAM** | 1024 MB |
| **Default CPU** | 1 core |
| **Port** | 3000 |
| **Features** | Auto-restart, Git-based deployment |

**Template Variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GIT_REPO` | *(required)* | Git clone URL |
| `GIT_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch or tag to deploy |
| `NPM_INSTALL_COMMAND` | `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` | Dependency install command |
| `START_COMMAND` | `npm start` | Fallback startup command |
| `BOT_START_COMMAND` | *(empty)* | Optional startup command override |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Application listen port (1024–65535) |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Node.js runtime environment |

### Understanding Template Variables

Templates use `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` syntax for interpolation in startup commands and install scripts. When you create a server, the panel replaces these placeholders with the values you provide.

**Example — Minecraft startup command:**
```
java -Xms{{MEMORY_XMS}}M -Xmx{{MEMORY}}M -jar paper.jar nogui
```

With `MEMORY=2048` and `MEMORY_XMS=1024`, this becomes:
```
java -Xms1024M -Xmx2048M -jar paper.jar nogui
```

**Built-in placeholders available in install scripts:**

| Placeholder | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{SERVER_DIR}}` | Absolute path to the server data directory |
| `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` | Any user-defined template variable |
| `{{TEMPLATE_IMAGE}}` | The container image specified in the template |

---

## Step 7: Create Your First Server

1. Navigate to **Servers** → **New server** (the dashboard **Create Server** shortcut links to `/servers`)
2. Fill in the server details:

#### Basic Settings

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Display name for your server | `My Minecraft Server` |
| **Description** | Optional description | `Survival server for friends` |
| **Node** | The node to deploy on | `node-1` |
| **Template** | Server template | `Minecraft Server (Paper)` |

#### Resource Allocation

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory (MB)** | RAM to allocate (backend range 512–131072) | `2048` |
| **CPU Cores** | CPU cores to allocate (backend range 1–128) | `2` |
| **Disk (MB)** | Disk space to allocate (backend range 1024–1048576) | `10240` |

Optional extras on the same step: **Swap (MB)**, **Backup (MB)**, and **Database Allocation** (blank = provider defaults). If the template defines **Image Variants**, pick one on the details step.

#### Network Settings

The creation wizard offers two **Network Modes**: `Host (port mapping)` and `Macvlan`.

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary Allocation** | Allocation picked from the node's pool (host mode) | `192.168.1.100:25565` |
| **Primary Port** | Read-only in host mode — populated from the allocation | `25565` |
| **Additional Port Bindings** | Extra allocation → container-port mappings | `25566` |
| **Interface / IP Allocation** | Macvlan interface + `Auto-assign` | `eth0` |

#### Template Variables

Fill in the template-specific variables (e.g., for Minecraft: Memory, Version, Build). Required fields are marked with an asterisk.

3. Click **Create server**

The server is created and installation **starts immediately** — you land on `/servers/:id/console`. The server is **not** left stopped waiting for a manual install.

### Accepting an Invite (Optional)

If someone invited you to a server, you'll receive an invite link:

**For existing users:**
1. Click the invite link.
2. Log in if prompted.
3. Click **Accept Invite** on the invite page.
4. You'll gain access to the invited server.

**For new users:**
1. Click the invite link.
2. You'll be taken to the registration page with your email pre-filled.
3. Fill in:
   - **Username** — your desired username (min 3 characters)
   - **Password** — your password (min 8 characters)
4. Click **Register**.
5. You'll automatically gain access to the invited server after registration.

> **Note:** The email on the invite cannot be changed during registration. If you need a different email, contact the person who sent the invite.

---

## Step 8: Installation (usually automatic)

Creating a server **starts installation immediately** in typical flows — you usually do **not** click a separate **Install** button after create.

While installing, the agent:

- Pulls the container image
- Creates the server data directory
- Runs the template install script in a temporary container
- Downloads game files (for example Paper.jar for Minecraft)
- Writes default configuration files

Watch progress on the **Console** tab. For Minecraft, installation typically fetches the Paper jar and creates default `server.properties` / `eula.txt`.

If installation fails or you need a clean reinstall:

1. Open the server detail page
2. Use **Admin → Reinstall** (or the reinstall control your role exposes)
3. Confirm — **reinstall wipes server data** and re-runs the install script

> **Warning:** Reinstall is destructive. Back up first if you need existing files.

---

## Step 9: Access the Console

The real-time console lets you interact with your server:

1. Go to your server's detail page
2. Click the **Console** tab
3. The console shows real-time server output via WebSocket
4. Type commands in the input field and press Enter to send them

**Console features:**
- Real-time output streaming (WebSocket)
- Command history (use arrow keys)
- Scroll through past output
- The console buffer is configurable via `CONSOLE_OUTPUT_BYTE_LIMIT_BYTES` (default: 256 KB)

**Common Minecraft console commands:**
```
help                   — Show available commands
list                   — List online players
op <username>          — Grant operator status
whitelist add <player> — Add player to whitelist
stop                   — Stop the server gracefully
```

---

## Step 10: Basic Server Management

### Start / Stop / Restart

Use the control buttons on the server page:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Start** | Boot the server container |
| **Stop** | Gracefully stop (sends the stop command, then SIGTERM) |
| **Restart** | Stop and start the server |
| **Kill** | Force-stop (sends SIGKILL immediately) |

### File Manager

Access your server files through the web UI:

1. Go to your server → **Files** tab
2. Browse the server directory structure
3. You can:
   - **Upload** files (drag and drop or click to select)
   - **Download** files
   - **Edit** text files directly in the browser
   - **Create** new files and directories
   - **Delete** files and directories
   - **Compress / decompress** archives (`.tar.gz`)
   - **Rename** files and directories

### SFTP Access

For SFTP access (agent-hosted on the **game node**):

1. Open the server → **SFTP** tab (or connection details from the UI)
2. Generate or copy the SFTP token from the panel (`GET /api/sftp/connection-info`)
3. Connect with your SFTP client using the values the panel shows:
   ```
   Host: <node public address or hostname>
   Port: <node SFTP port, often 2022>
   Username: <server-id>          # not your panel username
   Password: sftp_<token>         # opaque token, not a JWT
   ```

### Backups

Create and manage server backups:

1. Go to your server → **Backups** tab
2. Click **Create backup** (button label is sentence-case)
3. Backups can be stored locally or on S3 (configured per-server in **Backups** → storage settings; hidden when allocation is zero)
4. Download existing backups or restore them to the server

### Server Settings

Configure your server across two tabs:

- **Settings:** rename the server, update description, adjust memory/CPU/disk
- **Configuration:** edit template (startup) variables
- **Admin** (owner or admin-write/server-delete holders): node transfer, ownership transfer, port allocations, restart policy, suspension, archive/restore, delete, reinstall
