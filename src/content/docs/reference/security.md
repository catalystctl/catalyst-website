## License and Security

Catalyst is licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**. This means:

- **You have the right to study** how the software works and modify it
- **You have the right to distribute** copies and modifications
- **Security through transparency**: The source code is open for security review
- **No additional restrictions**: Security measures must not restrict GPL freedoms

This security policy complements, but does not override, your rights under the GPLv3 license.

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |
| develop | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Catalyst seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Private Disclosure Process

**Do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (Preferred)**
   - Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/catalystctl/catalyst/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the advisory form with details

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Affected component(s)** (backend, frontend, agent, or infrastructure)
- **Step-by-step reproduction instructions**
- **Proof of concept or exploit code** (if applicable)
- **Impact assessment** (what an attacker could achieve)
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment within 48 hours** confirming we received your report
2. **Initial assessment within 5 business days** with severity rating
3. **Regular updates** on our progress (at least every 7 days)
4. **Coordinated disclosure timeline** if the vulnerability is confirmed
5. **Credit in the security advisory** (if desired) once the issue is resolved

### Our Commitment

- We will not take legal action against security researchers who:
  - Follow this disclosure process
  - Act in good faith
  - Avoid privacy violations and data destruction
  - Avoid service disruption
  - Respect the GPLv3 license terms

- We acknowledge your GPLv3 rights to:
  - Study, modify, and redistribute this software
  - Report security issues publicly if you choose
  - Create and distribute security patches independently

- We kindly request coordinated disclosure to:
  - Protect users running unpatched versions
  - Provide time for users to update
  - Coordinate fixes across the community
  - **This is a request, not a legal requirement under GPL**

- We will work with you to:
  - Understand and validate the vulnerability
  - Develop and test a fix
  - Coordinate public disclosure timing
  - Give credit for the discovery (if desired)

## Security Vulnerability Response

### Severity Levels

We classify vulnerabilities using the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Immediate action required (remote code execution, authentication bypass)
- **High**: Prompt action required (privilege escalation, data exposure)
- **Medium**: Scheduled fix in next release (information disclosure, DoS)
- **Low**: Fix when convenient (minor information leak, low-impact bugs)

### Patch Timeline

- **Critical**: Patch within 24-48 hours, emergency release
- **High**: Patch within 7 days, expedited release
- **Medium**: Patch within 30 days, next scheduled release
- **Low**: Patch within 90 days, regular release cycle

## Security and GPL Freedoms

### Your Rights Under GPLv3

The GPLv3 license grants you important freedoms that apply to security:

1. **Freedom to Study**: You can examine the source code for security vulnerabilities
2. **Freedom to Modify**: You can create and deploy security patches
3. **Freedom to Distribute**: You can share security fixes with others
4. **No Tivoization**: Hardware running Catalyst cannot prevent you from running modified versions

### Anti-Tivoization (GPLv3 Section 6)

If you distribute Catalyst on hardware devices:
- You must provide Installation Information to allow users to install modified versions
- Users must be able to install security patches they create
- Technical protection measures cannot prevent modification
- This protects users' ability to secure their own systems

### Patent Grant (GPLv3 Section 11)

By contributing to or distributing Catalyst:
- You grant a patent license for your contributions
- You cannot use patent claims to restrict security fixes
- Contributors cannot sue users for patent infringement related to security patches

### Coordinated vs. Public Disclosure

Under GPLv3, you have the right to:
- **Publicly disclose** vulnerabilities immediately if you choose
- **Create and distribute** security patches independently
- **Fork the project** with security improvements

However, we kindly request:
- **Coordinated disclosure** to protect users of unpatched versions
- **Reasonable time** for maintainers to develop and test fixes (typically 90 days)
- **Collaboration** on fixes when possible

**This is a request for responsible disclosure, not a legal restriction. Your GPL rights remain intact.**

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

- **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens) to the repository
- **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **Keep dependencies updated** using Dependabot alerts
- **Run security scans** before merging PRs (`npm audit`, `cargo audit`)
- **Review RBAC permissions** when adding new endpoints
- **Validate all user input** on both frontend and backend
- **Use parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Sanitize file paths** to prevent path traversal attacks

### For Deployment

- **Use TLS/HTTPS** for all production deployments
- **Rotate secrets regularly** (`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `API_KEY_SECRET`, database passwords)
- **Enable database encryption** at rest
- **Implement rate limiting** on all public APIs
- **Use strong passwords** for all services (25+ characters)
- **Enable audit logging** for privileged operations
- **Keep systems patched** and up-to-date
- **Use container isolation** to limit blast radius
- **Implement network segmentation** between services
- **Regular security audits** of infrastructure

### For Users

- **Use strong passwords** for your Catalyst account
- **Enable two-factor authentication (TOTP)** and/or passkeys from **Profile → Security**
- **Review permissions** before granting access
- **Report suspicious activity** immediately
- **Keep your instance updated** with the latest security patches
- **Monitor audit logs** regularly for unusual behavior
- **Use API keys** instead of passwords for automation
- **Revoke unused tokens** and credentials

## Security Features

Catalyst is **free and open-source software**. Security features include:

- **Session authentication** via Better Auth (HTTP-only cookies; optional bearer session token)
- **API keys** (prefix `catalyst…`) stored as **HMAC-SHA256** digests (`API_KEY_SECRET`, falling back to `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`)
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with fine-grained permissions and server-scoped `ServerAccess`
- **Path validation** to prevent directory traversal on panel and agent
- **Input sanitization** on user-provided data
- **SQL injection protection** via Prisma ORM
- **Audit logging** for privileged operations (coverage evolves; do not assume every action is logged)
- **Rate limiting** on authentication and many public API routes
- **Container isolation** for game servers (containerd)
- **Secret scanning** in CI/CD pipelines (gitleaks)
- **Dependency scanning** via Dependabot
- **Agent-hosted SFTP** with opaque `sftp_` tokens and per-server path isolation (not OS chroot jails)

**All security features are open-source and auditable.** You are free to review, modify, and improve them under the GPLv3 license.

## Community Security

### Agent-Backend Communication

- Agent authentication uses a **node API key** (`NODE_API_KEY` / headers `X-Node-Api-Key` or legacy `X-Catalyst-Node-Token`), **not** a `NODE_SECRET` env var
- WebSocket connections are not encrypted by default on the wire
- **Recommendation**: Deploy backend with TLS/WSS in production
- **Recommendation**: Use VPN or private network for agent-backend communication when possible

### File Operations

- File operations are restricted to server-specific directories via path resolution on the agent
- Path traversal protection is implemented in both backend and agent
- SFTP password auth accepts **`sftp_`-prefixed tokens** only; the agent validates them with the backend (`POST /api/agent/sftp/validate-token`)
- Tokens are **opaque and in-memory** on the panel process (not JWTs). Multi-instance panel deployments do not share the token map unless architecture changes
- SFTP is hosted by the **node agent**, published by default on **`0.0.0.0:2022`** (public). Treat tokens as bearer secrets and restrict exposure on nodes in production

### Database Access

- Database credentials stored in environment variables
- Prisma ORM provides SQL injection protection
- **Recommendation**: Use read-only credentials where possible
- **Recommendation**: Enable PostgreSQL SSL in production

## Server access (authorization contract)

Authoritative implementation: `catalyst-backend/src/lib/server-access.ts` (`decideServerAccess`, `canAccessServer`, `getEffectiveServerPermissions`) and `ensureServerAccess` in server route helpers.

A caller may act on a server when **any** of the following holds:

1. They **own** the server
2. They have explicit **`ServerAccess`** including the required permission string
3. Their role includes global `*` or `admin.write`
4. They are **assigned to the server’s node** **and** have `node.update` (full server powers on that node)

**Not sufficient alone:** node assignment without `node.update`, `admin.read`, or a generic “user can see servers” role.

| Operation | Typical gate |
|-----------|--------------|
| Ownership transfer | Owner **or** `admin.write` only |
| Move server to another node | Owner, `ServerAccess(server.transfer)`, or admin/node_manage path |
| Reinstall (data wipe) | Owner, `admin.write`, or `ServerAccess(server.reinstall)` — **destructive** |
| Delete | Owner, `ServerAccess(server.delete)`, or admin/node_manage, plus lifecycle/suspension rules |

Default grants that include `server.delete` are security-sensitive — review server shares carefully.
